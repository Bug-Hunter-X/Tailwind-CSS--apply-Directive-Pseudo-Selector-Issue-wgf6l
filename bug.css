This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a class that contains a pseudo-selector like `hover`, `focus`, or `active`.  The `@apply` directive doesn't correctly handle these pseudo-selectors, resulting in the styles not being applied correctly or unexpectedly. For example:

```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  Click Me
</button>
```

```css
/* This works correctly */
.button {
  @apply bg-blue-500 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded;
}

/* This will only apply bg-blue-500 and not the hover effect */
.button {
  @apply bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded;
}
```

The hover effect won't apply because the `@apply` directive doesn't expand pseudo-selectors correctly.
