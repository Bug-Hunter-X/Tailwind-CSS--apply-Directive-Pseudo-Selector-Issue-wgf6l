The correct way to apply styles with pseudo-selectors in Tailwind CSS is to separate them from the `@apply` directive and directly apply them to the class. This example demonstrates the solution:

```css
.button {
  @apply bg-blue-500 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded;
}

.button:hover {
  @apply bg-blue-700;
}
```

This approach ensures that the pseudo-selector styles are applied correctly and avoids the bug associated with using `@apply` directly with pseudo-selectors.
